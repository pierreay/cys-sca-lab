#+TITLE: Cyber-In-Sophia's Side-Channel Attack Laboratory
#+DATE: July 2023
#+SETUPFILE: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierreay/orgcss/master/orgcss.setup

* About

Laboratory class during the Cyber-In-Sophia's event organized by EURECOM
in 2023. This laboratory is an introduction to side-channel attack analyzing
power and EM traces through Python. All credits to the author Thomas Hiscock
(CEA-LETI).

* Files

- [[file:lab.py]] :: Python script with code from original Jupyter notebook.
- [[file:solutions.html]] :: Guided solutions (code & explanation) for the lab.
- [[file:figs]] :: Some schemes and screenshots.
- [[file:data]] :: Provided traces.

* Highlights

In this lab, you'll learn to:
- Use the *Variance* to find where a leakage is.
- Use the *Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)* to find where a leakage is.
- Use the *Linear Regression Analysis* through the *Least-Square Method* to
  find how the leakage is and sorting its output to find out what the key's
  sub-byte is (this is the side-channel attack).
- Use the *Key Rank* to find how many traces are needed to perform the
  side-channel attack.
- Manipulating signals like *normalizing*, adding *noise* and *jitter*.

* Analysis

In the /3 - Leakage Analysis/ part, we can observe:
